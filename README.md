# Iris Data Analysis and Classification

This project involves analyzing the Iris flower dataset and performing data visualization and classification using machine learning techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. The Iris dataset contains data on the sepal and petal lengths and widths of three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flower species based on the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

We apply machine learning models to classify the species and evaluate their accuracy. We also explore the data through visualization techniques to better understand feature distributions and relationships.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is available as part of the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) and contains 150 observations with the following attributes:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
5. Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages using:
